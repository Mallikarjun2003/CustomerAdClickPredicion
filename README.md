# Customer Ad Click Prediction

## Project Overview

The Customer Ad Click Prediction project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a user will click on an advertisement. This is crucial for businesses and advertisers to optimize their ad campaigns, improve user engagement, and increase return on investment (ROI). By analyzing user data, such as time spent on the site, age, income, and internet usage, the model can provide valuable insights into user behavior and ad effectiveness.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- **Data Loading**: Load the dataset and explore its structure and contents.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Ensure there are no missing values to maintain data integrity.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Convert categorical variables into numerical formats using techniques like one-hot encoding.
- **Feature Scaling**: Normalize numerical features to ensure uniformity across the dataset.
- **Data Splitting**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Summary Statistics**: Generate summary statistics for numerical features to understand their distributions and central tendencies.
- **Unique Values**: Display unique values and their counts for categorical features to identify potential categories and anomalies.
- **Data Visualization**: Use histograms, box plots, and other visualization tools to explore the distributions of numerical features and the relationships between them.

### 3. Feature Selection
- **Constant Feature Removal**: Identify and remove features with constant values as they do not contribute to the predictive power of the model.
- **SelectKBest**: Use the SelectKBest method with ANOVA F-value to select the top features that have the highest impact on the target variable.

### 4. Model Building
- **Training Models**: Train several machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate each model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC score to determine the best-performing model.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use GridSearchCV to find the optimal hyperparameters for models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest to improve their performance.

### 5. Model Testing
- **Sample Test Data**: Use a sample dataset to test the trained model and ensure it makes accurate predictions.
- **Model Predictions**: Make predictions on the sample test data and display the results to verify the model's effectiveness.

## Project Importance

This project demonstrates the process of building a robust machine learning model to predict user behavior, specifically ad clicks. The insights gained from this project can help businesses tailor their advertising strategies, improve user targeting, and ultimately increase their advertising ROI. By understanding the key factors that influence ad clicks, companies can create more engaging and relevant ad content for their audience.

## Conclusion

The Customer Ad Click Prediction project showcases the end-to-end process of data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. The selected features, including daily time spent on the site, age, area income, and daily internet usage, play a crucial role in predicting ad clicks. The final model can be used by businesses to enhance their advertising efforts and achieve better outcomes.
